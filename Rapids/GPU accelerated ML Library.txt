Rapids is a GPU accelerated ML Library package that ports various ML algos from Scikitlearn library to provide accelerated computations on traditional ML algos.

This code takes the 1.2 million images and run accelerated KNN classifier on it to try and classify it. Though accuracy is nothing special


This code includes 

*code to install Rapids
*Preprocessing function
-Remove unformatted data, that is filter the image data that has more than 3 channels or don't have a default shape of 8x8
-flatten 8x8 image into a 64 valued vector for both training and prediction data
-Split the data into train and validation data and change dataformat to float32 (for RAPIDS)

*Program for K-NN
*Random Classifier
*Evaluation
*generate predictions in the required format and export in zip file.

The program has a for-loop that searches on multiple values of K to find the suitable value for such a large dataset.
